# How Kestra Could Enhance Pathoplexus

## Current Pathoplexus Workflow Architecture

Pathoplexus currently uses:
- Snakemake for bioinformatics pipelines (data integrity testing, ingestion)
- Container-based processing with Docker images for preprocessing/ingestion
- Manual/scheduled triggers for workflows
- GitHub Actions for deployment automation
- Kubernetes Jobs for batch processing

## Where Kestra Could Add Value

### 1. Unified Workflow Orchestration

Replace fragmented workflow systems with Kestra's declarative YAML approach:

```yaml
# Current: Multiple Snakemake files + K8s jobs + GitHub Actions
# With Kestra: Single orchestration layer
id: pathoplexus-processing
namespace: genomics

tasks:
  - id: ingest-ncbi-data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: ghcr.io/loculus-project/ingest
    script: |
      # Python ingest logic

  - id: nextclade-preprocessing
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: ghcr.io/loculus-project/preprocessing-nextclade
    script: |
      # Nextclade processing

  - id: data-validation
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    script: |
      # Data integrity checks
```

### 2. Event-Driven Processing

Replace scheduled/manual triggers with real-time event handling:
- Sequence submissions → Trigger preprocessing pipelines
- NCBI data updates → Automatic ingestion workflows
- Database changes → Data integrity validation
- External alerts → Automated response workflows

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring & Observability

Current system lacks centralized workflow monitoring:
- Visual workflow execution in Kestra UI
- Real-time status tracking of genomic processing jobs
- Failure alerts and automatic retry logic
- Performance metrics for sequence processing throughput

### 4. Cross-System Integration

Leverage Kestra's 600+ plugins:
- PostgreSQL integration for direct database operations
- Kubernetes plugin for advanced job management
- Slack/Email notifications for pipeline status
- AWS/GCP integration for cloud storage operations
- API calls to external genomic databases

### 5. Improved Data Pipeline Management

Current challenges Kestra could solve:

**Complex Dependencies:**
```yaml
# Current: Hard to manage cross-pipeline dependencies
# With Kestra: Clear dependency management
tasks:
  - id: sequence-qc
    type: genomics.nextclade
  - id: lineage-assignment
    type: genomics.phylogenetic
    dependsOn: [sequence-qc]
  - id: ena-submission
    type: genomics.ena-upload
    dependsOn: [lineage-assignment]
```

**Batch Processing:**
- Current batch_size: 100 configs → Dynamic batching based on system load
- Resource-aware scheduling for compute-intensive genomic analysis
- Parallel processing with automatic scaling

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements

- Version control for workflow definitions
- Testing/staging workflows before production
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Collaborative editing of genomic pipelines

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation

- Keep existing Snakemake pipelines
- Implement new workflows in Kestra
- Compare performance and reliability

### Phase 2: Selective Migration

- Move data integrity tests to Kestra first (lowest risk)
- Migrate ingestion pipelines for better event handling
- Keep core preprocessing in containers but orchestrate via Kestra

### Phase 3: Full Integration

- Replace Snakemake with Kestra for all workflows
- Implement advanced features (auto-scaling, complex triggers)
- Add custom genomics plugins if needed

## Potential Challenges

1. Learning curve for bioinformatics team
2. Migration complexity from established Snakemake workflows
3. Container integration - ensuring existing Docker images work seamlessly
4. Performance comparison - Snakemake is highly optimized for bioinformatics

## Conclusion

Yes, Kestra could play very well here by providing:
- Better event-driven automation
- Unified workflow management
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Improved developer experience
- More flexible integration capabilities

The genomics domain's need for complex, multi-step pipelines with external dependencies makes it an ideal fit for Kestra's declarative orchestration approach.
