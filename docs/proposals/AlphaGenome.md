# AlphaGenome Integration for Pathoplexus

## Current Pathoplexus Capabilities

Pathoplexus currently uses Nextclade for:
- Sequence alignment to reference genomes
- Basic mutation calling (substitutions, insertions, deletions)
- Phylogenetic clade assignment
- Quality control metrics (stop codons, frame shifts)
- Simple variant identification

## Where AlphaGenome Could Add Advanced Value

### 1. Enhanced Variant Impact Prediction

Current limitation: Pathoplexus identifies mutations but doesn't predict their functional impact.

AlphaGenome enhancement:
- Regulatory impact assessment - Predict how viral mutations affect gene expression regulation
- Pathogenicity scoring - Assess which variants might affect viral virulence or transmissibility
- Functional annotation - Understand the biological consequences of detected mutations

**Enhanced processing pipeline:**
Current: mutation detection → database storage
With AlphaGenome: mutation detection → impact prediction → functional annotation → database storage

### 2. Viral Genome Regulatory Analysis

Novel capability: Understanding viral regulatory mechanisms

Applications:
- Promoter region analysis - Identify regulatory sequences in viral genomes
- Expression level prediction - Predict how mutations affect viral gene expression
- Chromatin interaction modeling - Understand viral-host genome interactions (especially for DNA viruses like Mpox)

### 3. Advanced Quality Control

Current QC: Basic metrics (stop codons, frame shifts, alignment quality)

AlphaGenome-enhanced QC:
- Regulatory disruption detection - Flag mutations that may disrupt normal viral gene regulation
- Functional sequence validation - Ensure submitted sequences have biologically plausible regulatory patterns
- Annotation quality scoring - Assess confidence in gene predictions and annotations

### 4. Pathogen-Specific Insights

For RNA viruses (Ebola, West Nile, RSV, HMPV):
- Splice site prediction - Identify alternative splicing patterns
- RNA structure analysis - Predict secondary structure changes from mutations
- Replication control analysis - Understand regulatory elements affecting viral replication

For DNA viruses (Mpox):
- Host integration analysis - Predict integration sites and regulatory impacts
- Epigenetic modeling - Understand chromatin accessibility patterns
- Long-range regulatory interactions - Leverage AlphaGenome's 1M base pair capability

### 5. Evolutionary and Epidemiological Applications

Enhanced phylogenetic analysis:
- Functional constraint mapping - Identify which genomic regions are under selection pressure
- Adaptation prediction - Predict which mutations might confer adaptive advantages
- Emergence risk assessment - Flag variants with concerning regulatory changes

Public health applications:
- Vaccine escape prediction - Identify mutations affecting immune recognition
- Drug resistance forecasting - Predict resistance-conferring regulatory changes
- Transmissibility assessment - Understand mutations affecting viral fitness

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept

```yaml
# Add AlphaGenome as preprocessing step
preprocessing_pipeline:
  1. nextclade_analysis          # Current
  2. alphgenome_annotation       # New - regulatory prediction
  3. variant_impact_scoring      # New - functional assessment
  4. database_storage           # Enhanced with new annotations
```

### Phase 2: Integration with Search

```sql
-- Enhanced search capabilities
SELECT * FROM sequences
WHERE regulatory_impact_score > 0.8
  AND functional_disruption = 'high'
  AND organism = 'mpox';
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics

- Dashboard visualizations of regulatory impact distributions
- Alert systems for high-impact variants
- Comparative analysis across pathogen types

## Technical Considerations

### Computational Requirements

- AlphaGenome processing is computationally intensive
- May require GPU resources for large-scale analysis
- Could be implemented as optional "deep analysis" mode

### Data Integration

```yaml
# Enhanced metadata schema
metadata_additions:
  - regulatory_impact_score: float
  - predicted_expression_change: array
  - functional_disruption_sites: array
  - chromatin_accessibility_prediction: object
```

### Validation Approach

- Benchmarking against known functional variants
- Cross-validation with experimental data when available
- Comparative analysis with traditional annotation methods

## Limitations and Considerations

1. Training Data Gap: AlphaGenome trained on human/mouse data, not viral genomes
2. Computational Cost: Significant processing overhead
3. Validation Needs: Requires experimental validation for viral applications
4. Size Constraints: Most viral genomes are smaller than AlphaGenome's optimal range

## Potential Workflow Integration

```yaml
pathoplexus_enhanced_pipeline:
  sequence_submission:
    - basic_qc: nextclade
    - advanced_analysis: alphgenome  # Optional for high-priority sequences
    - annotation_merge: combine_predictions
    - database_storage: enhanced_metadata

  search_capabilities:
    - basic_search: current_functionality
    - functional_search: regulatory_impact_queries
    - comparative_analysis: cross_pathogen_insights
```

## Value Proposition

### For Researchers
- Deeper understanding of viral genome function
- Better variant prioritization for experimental follow-up
- Enhanced epidemiological insights

### For Public Health
- Improved risk assessment of emerging variants
